Testing
=======

We have three different kinds of tests that we might want to run in Flutter:

        Unit Tests: Test whether your code works.

        Widget Tests: Fast, close to codebase. Focused on Business needs.

        Integration Tests: Tests whether the components of your project interract properly.


Why is the Widget test ignored in most Flutter projects?


You need to learn a LOT!


Wouldn't it be great if you could create a test in an English language, and generate the requisite code for testing. Well for this, we have <strong>Flutter Gherkin.</strong>




The Gherkin magic makes some simple and initial tests, but it's up to you to write the rest of the tests!
